# Etch-A-Sketch

My take on the idea of the etch-a-sketch using CSS Grid and dynamically creating a square grid for The Odin Project

Mouse over the boxes to fill them in and create pixilated art as you see fit.
Click the reset button to clear the field and adjust the size of the grid.

# Planned Updates
- Update styles to my own liking
- Add an RBG mode to randomly change the color of the squares
- Add a color picker

- Maybe have a way to change from mouseover to click inorder to be precise with square selection.
